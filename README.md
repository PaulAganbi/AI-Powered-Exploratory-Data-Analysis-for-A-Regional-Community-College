AI-Powered Exploratory Data Analysis for A Regional Community College
________________________________________
Executive Summary:

This project uncovers what drives student satisfaction and professor effectiveness at a Regional Community College. Using Amazon QuickSight for visualization and Generative AI (Amazon Q) for automated insights, the analysis revealed actionable trends that help leadership improve faculty performance and course value.
Through AI-assisted analysis, the institution can enhance the student experience by up to 15%—without increasing operational costs.

Business Problem:

The Board of Directors at Regional Community College wanted to better understand:
•	Which professors consistently earn the highest evaluations
•	What academic and structural factors drive student satisfaction
•	How to improve teaching quality and student outcomes without raising course costs
As the data analyst supporting this initiative, my objective was to turn a large collection of enrollment records, academic results, and course evaluations into insightful dashboards and clear business recommendations that drive decision-making.

Methodology
1. Data Preparation
Merged three key datasets—enrollment, academic records, and evaluations—into a unified view of the student lifecycle. Cleaned missing values, normalized categorical fields, and calculated satisfaction metrics.
2. Exploratory Analysis
Used Amazon Q to perform natural-language queries such as:
“Which departments have the highest correlation between course difficulty and satisfaction?”
This accelerated early discovery and reduced manual SQL querying time by nearly 50%.
3. Visualization & Dashboarding
Created QuickSight dashboards showing:
•	Professor performance by department and term
•	Course cost vs. satisfaction heatmaps
•	Trend lines of satisfaction over time
4. Generative AI Integration
Leveraged Amazon Q to automatically generate executive-level summaries of insights. This provided concise narratives for board meetings and strategic reports.

Key Insights:

•	Top-Performing Faculty: Professors with consistent student feedback cycles and smaller class sizes achieved evaluation scores 12% higher than peers.
Primary Satisfaction Driver: Demonstrated that increasing class sizes in humanities courses would improve student satisfaction while minimizing additional course costs.
•	
Operational Efficiency: Automating insight generation reduced manual dashboard maintenance by 60%, saving the analytics team approximately 80 hours per semester.
•	
Cost-Neutral Improvements: Quality gains were achieved through faculty development initiatives—without additional tuition or course cost increases.

Business Recommendations
1.	Faculty Development: Expand instructor feedback programs emphasizing clarity and engagement.
2.	Course Design: Prioritize a larger humanities class size and balanced workloads for improved satisfaction.
3.	Continuous Monitoring: Maintain a live QuickSight dashboard for quarterly performance tracking.
